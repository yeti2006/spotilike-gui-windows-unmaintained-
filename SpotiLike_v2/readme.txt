Hey! Thank you for installing SpotiLike ðŸ’š

================================================================
It might take a while for the application to finish "Fetching" when you open it initially.
This is because it is downloading the icons of your private playlists. Well, depends on your interent connection :D. (Don't panic)
================================================================

Have a nice day! Also, if you're wondering why the application is installed in your Documents folder, that is because the app can't
open without adminstrator rights in the default Program Files folder unless UAC is disabled on that machine. You can always copy it and change it yourself :)
