Hey! Thank you for installing SpotiLike ðŸ’š

================================================================
It might take a while for the application to finish "Fetching" when you open it initially.
This is because it is downloading the icons of your private playlists. Well, depends on your 
interent connection :D. (Don't panic)
================================================================

Have a nice day!
